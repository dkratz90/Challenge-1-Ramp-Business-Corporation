"Revistioning Expense Management"

As a corporate accountant, I review the financial statements and entries of a company and the business expenses charged to credit cards. Reviewing each charge line by line in excel is very tedious and frustrating. There is no visualization used, or compiling of expenses. One startup that is making changes in the industry is Ramp Business Corporation.
Ramp was founded in 2019 by CEO Eric Glyman, CTO Karim Atiyeh, and CPO Gene Lee and began operations in early 2020. In 2014, Eric and Karim founded another startup, Paribus, "to help regular folks find and make use of better deals they might have missed out on" (1). Paribus gives users the ability to follow prices, get refunds, and repurchase at the cheaper process. A few years later, Capital One acquired the company. Next, the idea was "What if your credit card could help your business spend less money?". The idea for Ramp was formed, pivoting from consumers to businesses. The company has gone through a couple funding rounds. Ramp "raised $300 million in its latest funding round"(4). Investors were Thrive Capital and Sands Capital. The valuation was at $5.8 billion in August 2023. Previous funding provided a valuation at $8.1 billion with Microsoft's CEO Satya Nadella, Goldman Sach's, Redpoint Ventures, and Thrive Capital as funders (4). While the valuation did go down between funding rounds, the company believes it has just scratched the surface, with only about 1% of the market share (3).

Ramp's goal is to streamline, simplify, and automate company expense through their products and software, in four parts:
1: Start: company credit cards, expense management, and bill pay.
2: Scale: manage expense policies and visibility.
3: Steamline: accounting automation and integration.
4: Save: both time and money. 

In the beginning, the focus was on small to medium sized companies, but over time the company has been able to offer products to companies of all sizes in the United States. With companies looking to use technology to manage finances, the market size keeps growing. For example, I have a friend that runs a landscaping business. He uses a corporate AMEX card, but just looks at the bill and pays it each month. He would be a great customer of Ramp because it would automate his credit card expenses and bill pay into an accounting software to streamline his financials for the business. Ramp is in the payments & billing domain, providing products and services in many different aspects of the domain. Ramp is up against huge companies in the market. AMEX, SAP, and Bill.com process billions of dollars of expenses annually. The solution for ramp, offering all aspects of corporate expenses; credit cards, expense management software, and bill payments. Many of the competitors only provide one or two of those products. Ramp is a great solution for and all encompassing expense management that automates the expenses into many accounting softwares. Further, ramp gives great visualizations for spending habits. Similar to the Apple credit card, Ramps card provides great visualization tools for spending habits through businesses, maps/locations, and receipts. Furthermore, the credit card alerts users of duplicate subscriptions, unclaimed rewards, and lower pricing plans(5). On the expense management side, the mobile app allows users to submit expense reports, and managers to approve or deny. Giving workers and managers a simple and efficient way to submit expenses. These are then synced to the corporate accounting ERP (6). Another technology used is AI. One of the biggest buzz words of the last couple years. Ramp uses AI to "automatically extract key details from invoices and remembers how you code" (7). AP departments would absolutely love this. Manually reviewing invoices and debiting and crediting the correct general ledger codes is very tedious, on top of actually paying the bills. 

The business model of an all encompassing expense management product has allowed Ramp to pickup new customers for credit cards, but also, switch over to Ramp's expense management software. Picking up new customers with a free, no fee, company card gets them in the door. Then, after utilizing the product, the customers are building trust and a relationship with the company, pulling them into more products and services. CEO Eric Glyman stated "When using a standalone solution like Bill.com, a user has to connect that product to accounting software, and then connect their credit card to the reimbursement software so you could continue to operate your accounting software on it. Versus with Ramp, being able to manage it all in one platform with automated accounting, expense management and invoice processing." (1). Further impacts of Ramp include competition in one of the aspects of the domain pushing into others for full integration like Ramp. One of the reason's Ramp is growing so well is that there has not been much innovation in this domain over the last 5-10 years. Corporate cards, expense management, and bill payments were very much changed when the internet and computers became integral. However, that was decades ago and not much has changed since, at least for the major players. These major players need to catchup to Ramp by jumping into each part of the domain. AMEX is one of the leaders in corporate cards. However, they do not provide expense management software or bill payments. SAP concur is one of the most used expense management softwares, but it is slow and tedious and not integrated into the other aspects. Ramp has potential, but it is barely in the market. As stated above, it has about a 1% market share. It's got a long way to go to catchup to each player in each aspect of the domain. Only time and growth will tell. 

The cost to obtain a new customer, $0, for company credits cards is a brilliant idea. New customers are brought in and from there can go into the other products and services. The AMEX business card is $695 per year (8). While I've never heard of Ramp, I believe the company credit card is a better option for most businesses. But that's the problem, I had never heard of Ramp until now. If more advertising and promotions were utilized, I believe many people would see the difference. A free company card, that shows spending visualizations similar to the Apple Card, that gives cash back instead of miles/points. I think many small businesses will look into the card. Once the customers get the new card, showing them the other products and how efficient they are should bring in more business. The automation and integration would help out many small to medium businesses. Whole AP/AR, and bookkeeping departments could be automated by this one company. Once the AI tool is strong and trusted, even accounting departments could automated, or use this program to automate a large proportion of the current workload. Providing the customer's company savings in payroll, or allowing the accountants to work on more analytical roles. 

Overall, Ramp is in a great position. It could leverage its integration between the different aspects of the payments & billing domain to differentiate itself from its competitors. Using the free to start, and then pay for premium is a newer phenomenon, that is proven to bring in new customers. With AI in the mix, many accounting departments, or parts of accounting departments, could be automated and provide savings for customers. Ramp has set itself up for success and may drive even more changes to the payments domain.
